This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificates were at the top of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but are signed by an unknown\ncertificate authority :\n\n|-Subject : O=TurnKey Linux/OU=Software appliances\n|-Issuer  : O=TurnKey Linux/OU=Software appliances\n\n\n

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificates were at the top of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but are signed by an unknown\ncertificate authority :\n\n|-Subject : O=TurnKey Linux/OU=Software appliances\n|-Issuer  : O=TurnKey Linux/OU=Software appliances\n\n\n
