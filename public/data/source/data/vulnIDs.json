This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.  Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.
